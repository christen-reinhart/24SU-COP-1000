# Purpose: Calculate paycheck with Python Pseudocode

# start

# Prompt user for input and variables
# display "Enter the weekly salary: "
# input salary

# display "Enter the number of dependents: "

# Calculate state tax withholding at 6.5%
# stateTax = salary * 0.065

# Calculate federal tax withholding at 28.0%
# federalTax = salary * 0.28

# Calculate dependent deductions at 2.5% of the salary for each dependent
# dependentDeduction = salary * 0.025 * numDependents

# Calculate total withholding as stateTax + federalTax + dependentDeduction
# totalWithholding = stateTax + federalTax + dependentDeduction

# Calculate take home pay as salary - totalWithholding
# takeHomePay = salary - totalWithholding

# Output the results
# display "State Tax: $" + format stateTax to 2 decimal places
# display "Federal Tax: $" + format federalTax to 2 decimal places
# display "Dependent Deductions: $" + format dependentDeduction to 2 decimal places
# display "Salary: $" + format salary to 2 decimal places
# display "Take Home Pay: $" + format takeHomePay to 2 decimal places
