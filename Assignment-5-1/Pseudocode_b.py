# Input: 4, 6, 7
# Output: d, e, f

# start

# Constants
d = 4
e = 6
f = 7

# Loop until d is greater than f
while d <= f:
    d = d + 1  # Increment d by 1
    e = e - 1  # Decrement e by 1

# Print the final values of d, e, and f
print(d, e, f)

# end

# Pseudo Code Below

# start

# d = 4
# e = 6
# f = 7
# while d < f
    # d = d + 1
    # e = e - 1
# endwhile
# output d, e, f
