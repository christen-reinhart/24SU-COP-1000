# Purpose: Loop

# Performs Loop
# Input: 1, 2, 5
# Output: a, b, c

# start

# Constants
# a = 1
# b = 2
# c = 5

# Loop until a is no longer less than c
# while a < c:
# a = a + 1  # Increment a by 1
# b = b + c  # Increment b by the value of c

# Print the final values of a, b, and c
# print(a, b, c)

# end

# Pseudo Code Below

# start

# a = 1 
# b = 2
# c = 5
# while a < c
# a = a + 1
# b = B + c
# endwhile
# output a, b, c

# end

# Initialize variables
# a = 1 
# b = 2
# c = 5

# Loop until a is less than c
# while a < c:
# Increment a by 1
# a = a + 1
    
# Increment b by c
# b = b + c

# Output the values of a, b, and c
# print("a:", a)
# print("b:", b)
# print("c:", c)
