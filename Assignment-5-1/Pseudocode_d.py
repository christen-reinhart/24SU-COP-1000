# Author Name: Christen Reinhart
# Date of Latest Revision: 06/11/2024
# Purpose: Loop

# Performs Loop
# Input: 2, 5, 9
# Output: j, k, n

# start

# Constants
# j = 2
# k = 5
# n = 9

# Variable initialization
# m = 6

# Outer loop until j is greater than k
# while j <= k:
# Reset m to 6 at the beginning of each outer loop iteration
# m = 6
# Inner loop until m is no longer less than n
# while m < n:
# print("Goodbye")  # Print "Goodbye"
# m = m + 1  # Increment m by 1
# Increment j by 1 at the end of each outer loop iteration
# j = j + 1

# end

# Pseudo Code Below

# start

# j = 2
# k = 5
# n = 9
# while j < k
# m = 6
# while m < n 
# output "Goodbye"
# m = m + 1
# endwhile
# j = j + 1
# endwhile

# end

# Initialize variables
# j = 2
# k = 5
# n = 9

# Outer loop until j is less than k
# while j < k:
# m = 6
# n = 10  # Assuming n is defined; it's not given in the pseudo code

# Inner loop until m is less than n
# while m < n:
# Output "Goodbye"
# print("Goodbye")
# Increment m by 1
# m = m + 1
# Increment j by 1
# j = j + 1

# end
